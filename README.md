# Easy cuda pipenv setup
Pytorch's official page gives us a pip command to install Pytorch, which fails when using pipenv.
A workaround is to install directly from https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html.

Assuming this repo is up to date and the cuda version etc match your requirements, you can also install it using the Pipfile in here.
You can test the result using the test script.
